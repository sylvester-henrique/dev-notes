# Introduction

Microservices are a software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## Key characteristics of microservices

- Independently deployable services
- Business-focused services
- Decentralized governance
- Failure isolation
- Technology diversity
