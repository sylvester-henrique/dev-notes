# Components

Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. They control a portion of the view. It's important to organize your application into components to avoid code repetition and make the application easy to maintain and evolve over time.

## Key aspects of Angular components

- A TypeScript class with behaviors such as handling user input and fetching data from a server
- An HTML template that controls what renders into the DOM
- A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in HTML
- It is possible to create components with Angular CLI
- The selector property in the `@Component` decorator defines the HTML tag used to insert the component into templates.
- Use the `@Input` decorator to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
- Use the `@Output` decorator along with EventEmitter to send data from a child component to a parent component.

Example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent { }
```

## Best Practices for Creating Components

When designing components in an Angular application, following best practices ensures your app is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

- Each component should have one clear purpose.
- Avoid components that handle multiple unrelated concerns.

### 2. Break Down by UI Elements

- Create components for reusable UI sections (headers, footers, navigation bars, cards, forms, dialogs).
- If a section of a page is visually or functionally distinct, consider making it a component.

### 3. Reusability

- Identify UI or logic used in multiple places and encapsulate them as reusable components.

### 4. Container vs. Presentational Components

- **Container components:** handle data fetching, state management, and business logic.
- **Presentational components:** focus on rendering and receive data via `@Input`, emit events via `@Output`.

### 5. Keep Components Small

- Smaller components are easier to maintain, understand, and test.
- If a component grows too large, split it into smaller components.

### 6. Feature Modules

- Organize related components into feature modules (e.g., `UserModule`, `ProductModule`) for modularity and lazy loading.

### 7. Encapsulation

- Use Angularâ€™s encapsulation features to limit a componentâ€™s scope and avoid unintended side effects.

### 8. Avoid Deeply Nested Components

- Too many nested levels can make the app complex.
- Flatten the hierarchy where possible.

# Components lifecycle Hooks

Angular components have lifecycle hooks-special methods you can implement to react to different phases in a componentâ€™s existence. Common hooks include:

- **ngOnInit**: Called once after the component is initialized. Used for setup logic.
- **ngOnChanges**: Called when input properties change.
- **ngOnDestroy**: Called just before Angular destroys the component. Used for cleanup.
- **Others**: ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterContentInit, etc.
