# Components

Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. They control a portion of the view. It's important to organize your application into components to avoid code repetition and make the application easy to maintain and evolve over time.

Every component must have:

- A TypeScript class with behaviors such as handling user input and fetching data from a server
- An HTML template that controls what renders into the DOM
- A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in HTML

## Best Practices for Creating Components

When designing components in an Angular application, following best practices ensures your app is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

- Each component should have one clear purpose.
- Avoid components that handle multiple unrelated concerns.

### 2. Break Down by UI Elements

- Create components for reusable UI sections (headers, footers, navigation bars, cards, forms, dialogs).
- If a section of a page is visually or functionally distinct, consider making it a component.

### 3. Reusability

- Identify UI or logic used in multiple places and encapsulate them as reusable components.

### 4. Container vs. Presentational Components

- **Container components:** handle data fetching, state management, and business logic.
- **Presentational components:** focus on rendering and receive data via `@Input`, emit events via `@Output`.

### 5. Keep Components Small

- Smaller components are easier to maintain, understand, and test.
- If a component grows too large, split it into smaller components.

### 6. Feature Modules

- Organize related components into feature modules (e.g., `UserModule`, `ProductModule`) for modularity and lazy loading.

### 7. Encapsulation

- Use Angularâ€™s encapsulation features to limit a componentâ€™s scope and avoid unintended side effects.

### 8. Avoid Deeply Nested Components

- Too many nested levels can make the app complex.
- Flatten the hierarchy where possible.
